# Sports-Injury-Analysis
 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **FP29 Analytics Challenge**. The goal was to design an **Injury Analytics Dashboard** in **Power BI** that provides insights into sports injuries across players, genders, sports, and treatments.

The dataset contains **15,000 injury records** across **12,000+ clubs**, **19 injury types**, and **6 treatment methods**. The dashboard answers key questions on **injury frequency, severity, costs, demographics, and recovery**.

## 🔑 Key Insights

* 👩‍🦰 **65.5% of recorded injuries** were in female athletes, compared to 34.5% in males.
* ⏳ **Average recovery time**: 49.9 days (female) vs. 48.1 days (male).
* ⚠️ **Severe injuries**: 15.6% (female) vs. 14.7% (male).
* 💰 **\$27.7M total treatment cost** with an average of \~\$1.9K per injury.
* 🏟️ Top causes: **Falls (25.3%)**, **Contact (24.5%)**, **Overuse**.
* 🏋️ Most injuries by sport: **Football, Athletics, Basketball, Boxing, Tennis**.

## 📊 Dashboard Pages

1️⃣ **Summary** – KPIs, overall injury trends, and totals
2️⃣ **Demographics** – gender, age groups, competition level, and country insights
3️⃣ **Injury Analysis** – breakdown by injury type, cause, sport, and season
4️⃣ **Recovery Analysis** – treatments, costs, and return-to-play timelines

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

* **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards
* **Figma** – Dashboard background and layout design
* **Data Analytics** – Injury frequency, recovery time, severity, and cost analysis
* **Data Storytelling** – Communicating insights for sports medicine and athlete management
